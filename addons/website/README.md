blog title?" Just click and change. What you see is what you get. Really.

Awesome. Astonishingly Beautiful.

Odoo's building blocks allow to design modern websites that are not possible
with traditional WYSIWYG page editors.

Whether it's for products descriptions, blogs or static pages, you don't need
to be a professioanl designer to create clean contents. Just drag and drop and
customize predefined building blocks.

call-to-actions, jobs announces, events, customer references, blogs, etc.

core focus. With the Odoo integration, you benefit from the best management
software to follow-up on your orders, your jobs applicants, your leads, etc.

bootstrap. All your pages adapt automatically to the screen size. (mobile

works by default.

required.

and propagates translations automatically across pages, following what you edit
on the master page.

Benefit from professional translators to translate all your contents
automatically with the [Gengo](http://gengo.com) integration. Update any part
of your website and the translated versions are pushed automatically in a few
hours.

Designer-Friendly Templates

Templates are awesome and easy to design. You don't need to develop to create
new pages, themes or building blocks. We use a clean HTML structure, a
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS.

Customize every page on the fly with the integrated template editor. Distribute
your work easily as an Odoo module.

Fluid Grid Layouting

Design perfect pages by drag and dropping building blocks. Move and scale them
to fit the layout you are looking for.

Building blocks are based on a responsive, mobile friendly fluid grid system
that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size
increases.
