Odoo Supply Chain
=================

Automate requisition-to-pay, control invoicing with the Odoo
<a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/purchase">Open Source Supply Chain</a>.

Automate procurement propositions, launch request for quotations, track
purchase orders, manage vendors' information, control products reception and
check vendors' invoices.

Automated Procurement Propositions

Reduce inventory level with procurement rules. Get the right purchase
proposition at the right time to reduce your inventory level. Improve your
purchase and inventory performance with procurement rules depending on stock
levels, logistic rules, sales orders, forecasted manufacturing orders, etc.

Send requests for quotations or purchase orders to your vendor in one click.
Get access to product receptions and invoices from your purchase order.

Purchase Tenders

Launch purchase tenders, integrate vendor's answers in the process and
compare propositions. Choose the best offer and send purchase orders easily.
Use reporting to analyse the quality of your vendors afterwards.


Email integrations

Integrate all vendor's communications on the purchase orders (or RfQs) to get
a strong traceability on the negotiation or after sales service issues. Use the
claim management module to track issues related to vendors.

Standard Price, Average Price, FIFO

Use the costing method that reflects your business: standard price, average
price, fifo or lifo. Get your accounting entries and the right inventory
valuation in real-time; Odoo manages everything for you, transparently.

Import Vendor Pricelists

pricelists to make smarter purchase decisions based on promotions, prices
depending on quantities and special contract conditions. You can even base your
sales price depending on your vendor's prices.

Control Products and Invoices

No product or order is left behind, the inventory control allows you to manage
back orders, refunds, product reception and quality control. Choose the right
control method according to your need.

Control vendor bills with no effort. Choose the right method according to
your need: pre-generate draft invoices based on purchase orders, on products
receptions, create invoices manually and import lines from purchase orders,
etc.
