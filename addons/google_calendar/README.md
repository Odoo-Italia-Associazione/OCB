attendee(s)... All that without click on anything...

Create so easily an event

In just one click you can create an event...  You can drag and drop your event
if you want moved it to another timing.  You can shrink or extend the event if
you need to change the start's hours or the duration of your meeting.

Create recurrent event

You can also create recurrent events with only one event.  You need to create
an event each monday of the week ? With only one it's possible, you could
specify the recurrence and if one of this event is moved, or deleted, it's not
a problem, you can untie your event from the others recurrences.

but also their events by simply adding your favorites coworkers.  Every
coworker will have their own color in your calendar, and every attendee will
have their avatar in the event...
